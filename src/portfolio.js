Furthermore I aided in transitioning from a cesium mapviewer to leaflet mapviewer and converting cesium map entities with TypeScript to improve performance by 5-10x while maintaining original functionality. Lastly I took initiative and lead troubleshooting for a workaround during an unexpected SDE migration reducing team downtime by approximately 2-4 weeks",
